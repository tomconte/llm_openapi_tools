# LLM Function Tools

This project is a collection of tools to work with Function Calling in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT.

## Enriching OpenAPI specs for LLMs

The `llm_functools.openapi` module provides tools to enrich and specialize OpenAPI specs with additional information that can be used by LLMs to generate more accurate function calls. It uses a manifest file to configure the specialization process.
